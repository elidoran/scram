# Scripts library packaged with scram

I have yet to figure it all out yet, but, it's possible a user may use npm to
download this module and use this scripts folder to contain their own scripts
as well as those packaged with scram.

I have yet to put any scripts in here... but, this readme will hold it in git
until then.
