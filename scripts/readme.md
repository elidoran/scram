# Scripts library packaged with scram

I have yet to figure it all out yet, but, it's possible a user may use npm to
download this module and use this scripts folder to contain their own scripts
as well as those packaged with scram. The user can use npm to install node
modules into it and use them in their scripts as well. This avoids installing
scram globally and having the system environment issues for controlling where
the scripts are.

I have yet to put any scripts in here... but, this readme will hold it in git
until then.
