# Scram

## What **is** Scram for?

Help manage a large library of scripts and provide helpers when using the scripts.

## Why **use** Scram? Node and NPM already provide that.

I enjoy Node and NPM and encourage everyone to use them.

I'd like to make it easier for us to have script libraries full of scripts
which are robust, resilient, efficient, composable, and tested.

And, a run context which helps us do more than type the command and get the
error or results. For example:

1. pretty print a terminal console which is fixed in place
2. shows us status information about any scripts we currently have running
3. any errors which have occurred
4. helps us schedule scripts to run
5. helps run multiple scripts on the same input

## Why "scram" for a name?

I'll write it down before I forget... I was thinking things like "scriptable",
"module", and other words, when a thought about an article on the engineering of
scramjets popped into my head. The connection was made, and, "scram" was chosen.
